<h1 style="color:blue">Chest X-ray Diagnosis 💊😷 </h1><br>
<h2>Problem description : </h2>
<p>Given the chest X-ray dataset, our goal is to build a range of neural networks to diagnose chest
X-rays. Our database consists of patients suffering from COVID-19, Pneumonia, and normal Patients</p><br>
<h2>Procedure 🤔💡</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Get our Kaggle dataset that contains the COVID-19 database </li> 
  <li> We do some pre-cleaning to our dataset like: creating the train,validate,test arrays from the shuffeled data </li>
  <li> We repeat this procedure for the COVID-19, Pneumonia, and normal Patients' X-rays and then merge all corresponding training , validation, testing arrays</li>
  <li> Split our arrays into batches to ease up the training and testing procedures</li><br>
  
  <p>🎇🎇 We have implemented the basic neural network structure then the imrpoved version of them so we will start with the basic ones 😉🎇🎇</p>
  
</ol>
